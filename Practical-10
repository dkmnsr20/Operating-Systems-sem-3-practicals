# Practical 10: Write a Program to Implement Non-Preemptive Priority-Based Scheduling Algorithm

## Section 1: C Code
# Save this as 'practical10.c'
# Simulates non-preemptive priority scheduling: executes highest priority process first (lower number = higher priority).
# Ties broken by arrival time. Computes turnaround and waiting times.

#include <stdio.h>

struct Process {
    int id, arrival, burst, priority;
};

int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter number of processes: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    struct Process p[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        p[i].id = i + 1;
        printf("Enter arrival time for P%d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%d", &p[i].arrival);
        printf("Enter burst time for P%d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%d", &p[i].burst);
        printf("Enter priority for P%d (lower = higher priority): ", i + 1);
        scanf("%d", &p[i].priority);
    }

    // Sort by priority (ascending), then by arrival (ascending for ties)
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (p[j].priority > p[j + 1].priority || 
                (p[j].priority == p[j + 1].priority && p[j].arrival > p[j + 1].arrival)) {
                struct Process temp = p[j];
                p[j] = p[j + 1];
                p[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }

    printf("\nProcess\tArrival\tBurst\tPriority\tCompletion\tTurnaround\tWaiting\n");
    int current_time = 0;
    float total_tat = 0, total_wt = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (current_time < p[i].arrival) current_time = p[i].arrival;
        int completion = current_time + p[i].burst;
        int tat = completion - p[i].arrival;
        int wt = tat - p[i].burst;
        total_tat += tat;
        total_wt += wt;

        printf("P%d\t%d\t%d\t%d\t\t%d\t\t%d\t\t%d\n", p[i].id, p[i].arrival, p[i].burst, p[i].priority, completion, tat, wt);
        current_time = completion;
    }

    printf("\nAvg Turnaround Time: %.2f\nAvg Waiting Time: %.2f\n", total_tat / n, total_wt / n);

## Section 2: Linux Terminal Commands
# Run these in Ubuntu/Linux terminal to compile and execute

gcc -o practical10 practical10.c
./practical10

## Section 3: Expected Output/Input
# Interactive program: Follow prompts for input.
# Sample Input (enter at prompts):
Enter number of processes: 3
Enter arrival time for P1: 0
Enter burst time for P1: 5
Enter priority for P1 (lower = higher priority): 2
Enter arrival time for P2: 1
Enter burst time for P2: 3
Enter priority for P2 (lower = higher priority): 1
Enter arrival time for P3: 2
Enter burst time for P3: 8
Enter priority for P3 (lower = higher priority): 3

# Expected Output:
Process	Arrival	Burst	Priority	Completion	Turnaround	Waiting
P2	1	3	1		4		3		0
P1	0	5	2		9		9		4
P3	2	8	3		17		15		7

Avg Turnaround Time: 9.00
Avg Waiting Time: 3.67

# Notes:
# - Processes sorted by priority (P2 highest, runs first despite later arrival).
# - Non-preemptive: Once started, runs to completion.
# - Turnaround Time (TAT) = Completion - Arrival; Waiting Time (WT) = TAT - Burst.
# - Test with equal priorities to see arrival tie-breaker.
# - Run multiple times with varied inputs to demo starvation (low-priority waits long).
